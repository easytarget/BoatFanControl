# Code for the boat Fan Controller
Primary/complete code is in 'BoatFanControl' folder, please read the comments

The 'VoltageCalibrate' and 'SensorCalibrate' sketches are useful for verifying the hardware as well as checking calibration

Other folders contain test and/or experimental code I have played with

All code is for the DigiSpark board, ATTiny 85 based, and assumes the Arduino IDE is used

The tiny DHT11 sensor lib I use is from:
