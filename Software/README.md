# Code for the boat Fan Controller
Primary/complete code is in 'BoatFanControl' folder, please read the comments.

Other folders contain test and/or experimental code I have played with.

All code is for the DigiSpark board, ATTiny 85 based, and assumes the Arduino IDE is used.

The tiny DHT11 sensor lib I use is from:
